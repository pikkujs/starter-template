 * responsive props (`hiddenFrom`/`visibleFrom`) are `display: none` rather than conditional
 * rendering, so a control that appears once on screen can match twice in the DOM. An
 * unfiltered match would be a strict-mode violation, and taking the first would wait out a
 * timeout on the copy that is switched off.
 *
 * A remaining ambiguity is reported rather than guessed at — picking one would make the
 * scenario pass while proving something other than what it claims.
