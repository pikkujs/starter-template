/**
 * Assert the browser came to rest on exactly a path, naming where it went if not.
 *
 * This is the assertion half of `opensPage`, which deliberately only reports
 * where it landed. Keeping it a step rather than an `if`/`throw` in the scenario
 * body is what makes it count toward witness coverage — an assertion-free ladder
 * proves only that nothing threw, and the inspector fails the build over it
 * (PKU680).
 *
 * It asserts on the URL rather than page copy because every scaffolded app
 * rewrites its own copy; the route guard's behaviour is what the template can
 * still speak for. The match is exact rather than a prefix on purpose — the
 * redirect this exists to catch is `/app` → `/app/auth/login`, which any prefix test
 * would happily accept.
