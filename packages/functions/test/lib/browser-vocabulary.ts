/**
 * Shared plumbing for the generic browser steps, the scenario equivalent of what
 * `registerBrowserSteps` from `@pikku/cucumber/browser` used to supply. Nothing here is a
 * step — one stepper per file lives in `test/steps/`.
 *
 * The runner opens one BrowserContext per actor and signs it in at `signInPath` BEFORE the
 * first step runs, so there is no "log in" step and no signed-out state to drive. A scenario
 * that must start signed out clears the context itself (`browser.context.clearCookies()`),
 * which only makes sense in one that creates an identity.
 *
 * Do NOT set `XBROWSER_CDP_URL` in a sandbox. `@pikku/playwright` connects over CDP whenever
 * that variable is present and launches the in-image chromium (`PLAYWRIGHT_CHROMIUM_PATH`)
 * otherwise — setting it routes the whole sweep to an off-box browser that cannot reach this
 * app, which reads as every page failing at once.

 * `pikku:testids` vite plugin (apps/app/build/inject-testids.ts) — nothing has to be added
 * to a component for this to work. Addressing by key rather than by the text on screen is
 * what makes a scenario survive a reworded button, a redesign, and a locale switch: the
 * text is copy, the key is the control's meaning.
 *
 * Keys are REUSED on purpose — `m.common__save()` is one message on many forms — so a key
 * alone is ambiguous whenever two of them are on screen at once. That is what `within` and
 * `containing` are for, and why the plugin also stamps each component's root element with
 * its own name: `{ testId: 'common__save', within: 'entry-form' }` is the second form's
 * save button and nothing else.
