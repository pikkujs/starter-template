/**
 * Variables the deployer injects that no scaffold declares for it.
 *
 * `deploy.steps.ts` seeds one `<FRONTEND>_URL` per entry in
 * `pikkufabric.config.json`'s `frontends` at the stage's own scope, so this
 * project's single `app` frontend gets `APP_URL`. Without a declaration the row
 * exists with nothing claiming it and the cascade dashboard reports it as
 * "set but not declared". Add one of these per frontend you add.
 *
 * It is `optional` because the value only exists once the stage has deployed —
 * local and pre-deploy runs have no hostname to seed from, and the deploy gate
 * must not demand a value it is itself about to write.
