/**
 * Run the testid stamper over the app's JSX.
 *
 * A standalone pre-transform rather than a `babel` option on `@vitejs/plugin-react`, which
 * mirrors how `apps/console` runs its `data-om` plugin and for the same reason:
 * plugin-react@6 is the rolldown/oxc build and has NO babel option, so a transform hung off
 * that option stops running on the version bump — silently, since the app still builds and
 * only the scenarios notice. Owning the babel pass costs one extra parse of the app's own
 * source in exchange for surviving that.
 *
 * NOT `apply: 'serve'`: scenarios drive the built sandbox app as well as the dev server, so
 * a dev-only stamp would leave every deployed app unaddressable.
